We take every comment, criticism, and praise seriously and work hard to incorporate the needs of the community in everything we do.

We take every comment, criticism, and praise seriously and work hard to incorporate the needs of the community in everything we do.

Even still, the database is constantly growing, adding the newest releases to keep fueling the WOD fire. We hand select the music played so you never have to worry about low energy songs, or scramble across the room to change explicit music, or keep your gym going through another audio commercial, or create another up tempo playlist. XFPlaylist has it all covered by simply playing the best WOD music on demand. Always.\r\n\r\n    * Why should I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist was created by members of the crossfit community and is specifically designed to meet the needs and desires of the crossfit community. We’ve worked to develop a system that works for you in ways premade MP3 playlists and internet radio sites can’t. Our player delivers a superior WOD playlist every time because we’ve hand selected only the best workout tracks from all genres, providing unlimited variety while virtually eliminating repeats and removing non-workout songs. And we are continually updating our database with the newest releases. XFPlaylist gives you more control over your music by allowing you to set your own mix of genres to your preference and allowing you to filter out explicit content. Even more, we pledge there will never be any WOD killing talking breaks or commercials. So, you never have to spend time making another new playlist. Say goodbye to stale MP3 soundtracks and low energy songs. If you can get internet in your gym, its time to see what XFPlaylist, the only player designed with you in mind, can offer.\r\n\r\n    * How do I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nIt’s simple! If you can hook up a computer or smartphone to your stereo, and you have internet available (including 3G or 4G) you can use XFPlaylist. Simply register your gym on XFPlaylist.com with a username and password, then access the site from a device connected to the internet, connect it to your stereo and hit play to start hearing excellent music for your WOD. When changing classes or instructors, just sign out on the outgoing device and sign in on the new one and you’re ready to go.\r\n\r\n    * How much does it cost and how do I pay?\r\n\r\nAn XFPlaylist membership costs $4.99 a month and includes unlimited access to commercial free WOD playlists, our crossfit blog, our community activities, and the rest of the site.

We are working to bring a solution to this problem as quickly as possible and will keep you up to date on our progress. Sorry for any inconvenience.\r\n\r\n * Why doesn\'t the playlist keep loading on my mobile device?\r\n\r\nIn order for XFPlaylist to keep loading music, your mobile device must be in active mode. Therefore, to ensure continuous play, change your settings so that your device does not \'sleep\' during the WOD.\r\n\r\n * What is XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist is a site for the crossfit community, designed to play the best workout music, interruption free, all the time. XFPlaylist was built to provide a range of all genres so it delivers the greatest variety, all while giving you the power to easily tailor the tracks to your taste. The XFPlaylist database is designed to be large enough to virtually eliminate repeat songs and completely remove repeat playlists. Even still, the database is constantly growing, adding the newest releases to keep fueling the WOD fire. We hand select the music played so you never have to worry about low energy songs, or scramble across the room to change explicit music, or keep your gym going through another audio commercial, or create another up tempo playlist. XFPlaylist has it all covered by simply playing the best WOD music on demand. Always.\r\n\r\n * Why should I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist was created by members of the crossfit community and is specifically designed to meet the needs and desires of the crossfit community. We’ve worked to develop a system that works for you in ways premade MP3 playlists and internet radio sites can’t. Our player delivers a superior WOD playlist every time because we’ve hand selected only the best workout tracks from all genres, providing unlimited variety while virtually eliminating repeats and removing non-workout songs. And we are continually updating our database with the newest releases. XFPlaylist gives you more control over your music by allowing you to set your own mix of genres to your preference and allowing you to filter out explicit content. Even more, we pledge there will never be any WOD killing talking breaks or commercials. So, you never have to spend time making another new playlist. Say goodbye to stale MP3 soundtracks and low energy songs. If you can get internet in your gym, its time to see what XFPlaylist, the only player designed with you in mind, can offer.\r\n\r\n * How do I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nIt’s simple! If you can hook up a computer or smartphone to your stereo, and you have internet available (including 3G or 4G) you can use XFPlaylist. Simply register your gym on XFPlaylist.com with a username and password, then access the site from a device connected to the internet, connect it to your stereo and hit play to start hearing excellent music for your WOD. When changing classes or instructors, just sign out on the outgoing device and sign in on the new one and you’re ready to go.\r\n\r\n * How much does it cost and how do I pay?\r\n\r\nAn XFPlaylist membership costs $4.99 a month and includes unlimited access to commercial free WOD playlists, our crossfit blog, our community activities, and the rest of the site. Signing up is easy with a credit card. Credit cards are billed once per month. All payments are made securely through paypal and can be easily tracked.

Even still, the database is constantly growing, adding the newest releases to keep fueling the WOD fire.

XFPlaylist has it all covered by simply playing the best WOD music on demand. Always.\r\n\r\n * Why should I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist was created by members of the crossfit community and is specifically designed to meet the needs and desires of the crossfit community.

And we are continually updating our database with the newest releases. XFPlaylist gives you more control over your music by allowing you to set your own mix of genres to your preference and allowing you to filter out explicit content. Even more, we pledge there will never be any WOD killing talking breaks or commercials. So, you never have to spend time making another new playlist.

When changing classes or instructors, just sign out on the outgoing device and sign in on the new one and you’re ready to go.\r\n\r\n * How much does it cost and how do I pay?\r\n\r\nAn XFPlaylist membership costs $4.99 a month and includes unlimited access to commercial free WOD playlists, our crossfit blog, our community activities, and the rest of the site.

We are still developing (everything about the site) this section so if you can't find an answer you're looking for, don't hesitate to email us at XFPlaylist@gmail.com \r\n\r\n* First off, the playlist currently works the best when used with a fast internet connection. 3G wireless doesn't seem to be able to load content fast enough.\r\n\r\n* Also, avoid using Internet Explorer with XFPlaylist because we have experienced sign in difficulties. Other browsers are fine though.\r\n\r\nNow on to the questions:\r\n\r\n* Is it legal?\r\n\r\nYes! XFPlaylist cannot stress enough that youtube is not charging you in any way to view their content, all charges are being created by XFPlaylist. Additionally, members are paying for access to the entire website, not simply the video content. Watching a video on XFPlaylist is the equivalent of watching it on youtube.\r\n\r\n* Why doesn’t XFPlaylist work on my iPod?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple devices do not support Adobe’s flash player, a critical component for XFPlaylist. We are working to bring a solution to this problem as quickly as possible and will keep you up to date on our progress. Sorry for any inconvenience.\r\n\r\n* Why doesn't the playlist keep loading on my mobile device?\r\n\r\nIn order for XFPlaylist to keep loading music, your mobile device must be in active mode. Therefore, to ensure continuous play, change your settings so that your device does not 'sleep' during the WOD.\r\n\r\n* What is XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist is a site for the crossfit community, designed to play the best workout music, interruption free, all the time. XFPlaylist was built to provide a range of all genres so it delivers the greatest variety, all while giving you the power to easily tailor the tracks to your taste. The XFPlaylist database is designed to be large enough to virtually eliminate repeat songs and completely remove repeat playlists. Even still, the database is constantly growing, adding the newest releases to keep fueling the WOD fire. We hand select the music played so you never have to worry about low energy songs, or scramble across the room to change explicit music, or keep your gym going through another audio commercial, or create another up tempo playlist. XFPlaylist has it all covered by simply playing the best WOD music on demand. Always.\r\n\r\n* Why should I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist was created by members of the crossfit community and is specifically designed to meet the needs and desires of the crossfit community. We’ve worked to develop a system that works for you in ways premade MP3 playlists and internet radio sites can’t. Our player delivers a superior WOD playlist every time because we’ve hand selected only the best workout tracks from all genres, providing unlimited variety while virtually eliminating repeats and removing non-workout songs. And we are continually updating our database with the newest releases. XFPlaylist gives you more control over your music by allowing you to set your own mix of genres to your preference and allowing you to filter out explicit content. Even more, we pledge there will never be any WOD killing talking breaks or commercials. So, you never have to spend time making another new playlist. Say goodbye to stale MP3 soundtracks and low energy songs. If you can get internet in your gym, its time to see what XFPlaylist, the only player designed with you in mind, can offer.\r\n\r\n* How do I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nIt’s simple! If you can hook up a computer or smartphone to your stereo, and you have internet available (including 3G or 4G) you can use XFPlaylist. Simply register your gym on XFPlaylist.com with a username and password, then access the site from a device connected to the internet, connect it to your stereo and hit play to start hearing excellent music for your WOD. When changing classes or instructors, just sign out on the outgoing device and sign in on the new one and you’re ready to go.\r\n\r\n* How much does it cost and how do I pay?\r\n\r\nAn XFPlaylist membership costs $4.99 a month and includes unlimited access to commercial free WOD playlists, our crossfit blog, our community activities, and the rest of the site. Signing up is easy with a credit card. Credit cards are billed once per month. All payments are made securely through paypal and can be easily tracked.

  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"✓", "authenticity_token"=>"Quql5J1QfYM2batZnLdjw/UyT5WXRwj5gUnAoa/Qjrw=", "page"=>{"title"=>"FAQ", "body"=>"Welcome to the FAQ. We are still developing (everything about the site) this section so if you can't find an answer you're looking for, don't hesitate to email us at XFPlaylist@gmail.com \r\n\r\n* First off, the playlist currently works the best when used with a fast internet connection. 3G wireless doesn't seem to be able to load content fast enough.\r\n\r\n* Also, avoid using Internet Explorer with XFPlaylist because we have experienced sign in difficulties. Other browsers are fine though.\r\n\r\nNow on to the questions:\r\n\r\n* Is it legal?\r\n\r\nYes! XFPlaylist cannot stress enough that youtube is not charging you in any way to view their content, all charges are being created by XFPlaylist. Additionally, members are paying for access to the entire website, not simply the video content. Watching a video on XFPlaylist is the equivalent of watching it on youtube.\r\n\r\n* Why doesn’t XFPlaylist work on my iPod?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple devices do not support Adobe’s flash player, a critical component for XFPlaylist. We are working to bring a solution to this problem as quickly as possible and will keep you up to date on our progress. Sorry for any inconvenience.\r\n\r\n* Why doesn't the playlist keep loading on my mobile device?\r\n\r\nIn order for XFPlaylist to keep loading music, your mobile device must be in active mode. Therefore, to ensure continuous play, change your settings so that your device does not 'sleep' during the WOD.\r\n\r\n* What is XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist is a site for the crossfit community, designed to play the best workout music, interruption free, all the time. XFPlaylist was built to provide a range of all genres so it delivers the greatest variety, all while giving you the power to easily tailor the tracks to your taste. The XFPlaylist database is designed to be large enough to virtually eliminate repeat songs and completely remove repeat playlists. Even still, the database is constantly growing, adding the newest releases to keep fueling the WOD fire. We hand select the music played so you never have to worry about low energy songs, or scramble across the room to change explicit music, or keep your gym going through another audio commercial, or create another up tempo playlist. XFPlaylist has it all covered by simply playing the best WOD music on demand. Always.\r\n\r\n* Why should I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nXFPlaylist was created by members of the crossfit community and is specifically designed to meet the needs and desires of the crossfit community. We’ve worked to develop a system that works for you in ways premade MP3 playlists and internet radio sites can’t. Our player delivers a superior WOD playlist every time because we’ve hand selected only the best workout tracks from all genres, providing unlimited variety while virtually eliminating repeats and removing non-workout songs. And we are continually updating our database with the newest releases. XFPlaylist gives you more control over your music by allowing you to set your own mix of genres to your preference and allowing you to filter out explicit content. Even more, we pledge there will never be any WOD killing talking breaks or commercials. So, you never have to spend time making another new playlist. Say goodbye to stale MP3 soundtracks and low energy songs. If you can get internet in your gym, its time to see what XFPlaylist, the only player designed with you in mind, can offer.\r\n\r\n* How do I use XFPlaylist?\r\n\r\nIt’s simple! If you can hook up a computer or smartphone to your stereo, and you have internet available (including 3G or 4G) you can use XFPlaylist. Simply register your gym on XFPlaylist.com with a username and password, then access the site from a device connected to the internet, connect it to your stereo and hit play to start hearing excellent music for your WOD. When changing classes or instructors, just sign out on the outgoing device and sign in on the new one and you’re ready to go.\r\n\r\n* How much does it cost and how do I pay?\r\n\r\nAn XFPlaylist membership costs $4.99 a month and includes unlimited access to commercial free WOD playlists, our crossfit blog, our community activities, and the rest of the site. Signing up is easy with a credit card. Credit cards are billed once per month. All payments are made securely through paypal and can be easily tracked. Your peace of mind is our concern and your satisfaction is guaranteed."}, "commit"=>"Save changes", "id"=>"2"}

The idea for XFPlayist came in the summer of 2010 in San Diego, when we realized the gym we went to everyday did not have an easy way to play blood pumping, adrenaline rushing music for every WOD. We think the right kind of music can mean the difference between a mediocre workout and the kind of workout crossfit is intended to be: an all out, gut wrenching, hardest-workout-of-your-life-until-tomorrow workout. So, we conceived and designed XFPlaylist by taking our vision and listening to what the community wanted by talking to as many other members and affiliates as we could. And, in July of 2011, we were ready to show the crossfit community our vision of the perfect WOD playlist. Never constant, always fresh, always intense.\r\n\r\nOur dedication to the crossfit community runs deep. Our vision is to have a site that not only plays WOD playlists but has an active part in the crossfit culture. And we continue to listen to the community every day. Like crossfit, XFPlaylist is alive and active, always striving to bring its members the best. We take every comment, criticism, and praise seriously and work hard to incorporate the needs of the community in everything we do. We’re dedicated to bringing the best WOD to every crossfit gym because we know our playlist is, after all, of greatest benefit to the members pushing themselves through a tough WOD and to the trainers who are providing the atmosphere and the encouragement to keep them going strong. We’re right there with you.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank you personally for your support of XFPlaylist."}, "commit"=>"Save changes", "id"=>"1"}

The idea for XFPlayist came in the summer of 2010 in San Diego, when we realized the gym we went to everyday did not have an easy way to play blood pumping, adrenaline rushing music for every WOD. We think the right kind of music can mean the difference between a mediocre workout and the kind of workout crossfit is intended to be: an all out, gut wrenching, hardest-workout-of-your-life-until-tomorrow workout. So, we conceived and designed XFPlaylist by taking our vision and listening to what the community wanted by talking to as many other members and affiliates as we could. And, in July of 2011, we were ready to show the crossfit community our vision of the perfect WOD playlist. Never constant, always fresh, always intense.\r\n\r\nOur dedication to the crossfit community runs deep. Our vision is to have a site that not only plays WOD playlists but has an active part in the crossfit culture. And we continue to listen to the community every day. Like crossfit, XFPlaylist is alive and active, always striving to bring its members the best. We take every comment, criticism, and praise seriously and work hard to incorporate the needs of the community in everything we do. We’re dedicated to bringing the best WOD to every crossfit gym because we know our playlist is, after all, of greatest benefit to the members pushing themselves through a tough WOD and to the trainers who are providing the atmosphere and the encouragement to keep them going strong. We’re right there with you.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank you personally for your support of XFPlaylist."}, "commit"=>"Save changes", "id"=>"1"}
