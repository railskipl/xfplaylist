<p>You are about to cancel your account. This will <strong>permanently delete all of the data associated with it</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you do this, you will no longer have access to your data, so be sure this is really what you want to do.</p>

<h2>Wait! Before you go...</h2>

  Instead of canceling your account, perhaps you'd like to just switch your plan.
